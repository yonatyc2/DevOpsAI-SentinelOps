Specification document

AI DevOps Assistant for Linux, Docker & PostgreSQL

1️⃣ Executive Summary

SentinelOps AI is an intelligent DevOps assistant that:

Connects to Linux servers

Analyzes Docker, LVM, disk, memory and PostgreSQL

Detects issues

Explains them in plain English

Suggests safe remediation steps

Optionally executes approved commands

It acts as an AI SRE Copilot for infrastructure teams.

2️⃣ Problem Statement

Modern infrastructure environments suffer from:

Disk mismanagement (LVM shrink risks, full disks)

Docker restart loops

PostgreSQL performance issues

Complex debugging across logs

Risky manual production commands

There is no assistant that:

Understands infrastructure state

Reasons safely

Prevents destructive commands

Speaks DevOps language

3️⃣ Product Goals
Primary Goals

Reduce downtime

Improve troubleshooting speed

Prevent catastrophic commands

Provide structured AI reasoning

Secondary Goals

Historical incident tracking

Multi-server monitoring

Enterprise-ready SaaS

4️⃣ Target Users

DevOps Engineers

SRE Teams

Infrastructure Administrators

Backend Engineers managing servers

5️⃣ Core Features (MVP Scope)
🔹 1. Chat Interface

User types:

“Why is /data almost full?”

“Why is Docker restarting?”

“Can I safely remove sdl?”

“Why is Postgres slow?”

System replies with:

Analysis

Root cause

Safe action plan

Risk warnings

🔹 2. System Snapshot Engine

Collect structured data:

Linux

df -h

lsblk

pvs, vgs, lvs

free -m

uptime

systemctl status

Docker

docker ps

docker inspect

restart counts

docker stats

PostgreSQL

pg_stat_activity

database sizes

slow queries

locks

Convert everything into structured JSON.

🔹 3. AI Reasoning Engine

LLM receives:

{
  "disk": {...},
  "lvm": {...},
  "docker": {...},
  "postgres": {...}
}


And responds with:

Diagnosis

Confidence level

Risk classification

Step-by-step remediation

🔹 4. Safe Command Mode

Two modes:

Safe Mode (Default)

AI suggests commands only

No execution

Execute Mode

User approves command

Backend runs via SSH

Logs execution

Rollback suggestions generated

🔹 5. Audit Log

Store:

System snapshots

AI conversations

Commands executed

User confirmations

6️⃣ Non-Functional Requirements

Read-only by default

Role-based command permissions

Secure SSH key storage

No destructive command execution without confirmation

All actions logged

7️⃣ Architecture
Frontend

React (Vite)

Chat interface

System dashboard

Risk indicators

Backend

Spring Boot

REST API

SSH module

Command Executor

AI integration service

Database

PostgreSQL

Store:

Servers

Snapshots

Chat history

Commands

AI

OpenAI API (initial)

Later: Ollama local LLM

8️⃣ System Modules
1. Server Connector Module

SSH connection

Command execution

Timeout management

2. Snapshot Analyzer

Runs commands

Parses output

Converts to structured model

3. AI Engine

Prompt templating

Context builder

Response validator

Safety filter

4. Risk Engine
